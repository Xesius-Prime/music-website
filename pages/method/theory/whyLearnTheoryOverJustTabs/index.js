            <h2>Why Learn Notation <br /> Over Just Tabs?</h2>

            <h3>Notation is a Universal Language <br /> from Instrument to Instrument</h3>
            <div className={globalStyle.leftAlign}>
                <p>All music is encapsulated within notation, whereas only stringed instruments are encapsulated in tabs.</p>
                <p>By understanding music through notation, you can understand music for basically every single instrument.</p>
                <p>This of course allows you to more easily go from one instrument to another.</p>
                <p>Tabs is like the language of your home country. <br /> Notation is like the language of the world.</p>
                <p>By knowing a popular international language, then you can travel to many countries, and still function quite well, as opposed to being trapped in just one country (trapped in one instrument), as a result of not knowing the international language.</p>
            </div>
            <br />

            <h3>Tabs Lacks Some Data</h3>
            <div className={globalStyle.leftAlign}>
                <p>Tabs doesn't have the note names, although you can descern it from understanding theory, and applying it to the fretboard with tabs.</p>
            </div>
            <br />

            <h3>Rhythm</h3>
            <div className={globalStyle.leftAlign}>
                <p>Rhythm is one of the things thats not usually shown in tabs, although there are tabs that do incorporate it.</p>
            </div>
            <br />

            <h3>Tab Players Have to Rely On Things <br /> Outside the Piece of Paper</h3>
            <br />



            <h3>Learning to Read Notation <br /> is Great for the Brain</h3>
            <div className={globalStyle.leftAlign}>
                <p>Increases IQ.</p>
                <p>Reduces cognitive decline as you get older.</p>
                <p>- When you listen to music your brain lights up. <br />
                    - When you play music, your brain lights up even more, <br />
                    - but when you <b>sight read music</b>, you brain lights up like the Queens jubilee fireworks!</p>
