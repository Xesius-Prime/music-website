            <h3>Tally the Hours and Reward Yourself <br /> After a Certain Amount Is Obtained</h3>

                <p>To encourage myself to work on difficult things, I use a timer to see how long I work on those difficult things.</p>
                <p>Every hour I obtain, I click a gold button (that I bought from Amazon), and it plays victory music, and then I make a tally mark on a piece of sticky note paper, to track my hours.</p>
                <p>Once I reach 10 hours, I go to Amazon and buy myself something around $10, so it's like a dollar per hour, but you could change it to whatever you want, like make it $3 per hour, so after 10 hours of work you can buy a $30 item.</p>
                <p>If you are a child, and don't have the money to buy yourself things, maybe you can talk to your parents.</p>
                <p>I find this highly motivational. I go on Amazon and browse around at things I like and want to buy, and then I add it to my cart so I can look at it later, and once I've obtained my hours, I go to the shopping cart and look to see what I want to purchase with my hours worked.</p>

            <h3>Put Instrument in an Easily Accessible Location</h3>

                <p>Do you put your instrument in an easily accessible location, or do you leave it in it's case, far away in the basement?</p>
                <p>Once I had a student who, after our lesson, she didn't take her guitar out of the case, but left it in the basement. I said no wonder she wasn't practicing, because she told me she spent most of her time in the living room upstairs,</p>
                <p>so in order for her to practice, she would have to go all the way downstairs to the cold basement, take the guitar out of the case, and get set up with her music etc, and then play, and unfortunately thats often too much to ask for many students.</p>
                <p>Even for me, which is why I put my instruments I want to play in the most easily accessible locations. For my guitar it's literally in arms length from my chair I'm sitting in right now.</p>
                <p>For my piano, it's just downstairs, and when I take a break from some stuff I'm working on, I like to go get a refreshing drink, or get something to snack on, and I lets say I'm toasting some bread, or boiling some water for tea. While I'm waiting for the bread to toast or the water to boil, I will often sit down at my piano, which is right there, and play a few pieces.</p>
                <p>Practice while you play other things. For instance, if you play video games, then do a little practice every time your character dies.</p>
                <p>Use playing music as a way to take a break from work.</p>

            <h3>Put Instrument in Area Where You Can Actually Play It</h3>
            <img src="https://graphicriver.img.customer.envatousercontent.com/files/459782403/preview.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&q=80&fit=crop&crop=top&max-h=8000&max-w=590&s=1abc22216cb0e724a7c4ed6bbdb58e68" alt="" />
            <div className={globalStyle.leftAlign}>
                <p>Right now the piano I normally play is in the living room downstairs.</p>
                <p>I couldn't practice piano, even if I wanted to, because at the end of the day people are in the living room watching TV, and my practicing would disturb them.</p>
                <p>So the only time for me to play is earlier in the morning and afternoon, or later in the night when they've gone to bed on the other side of the house where no one can hear me play.</p>
                <p>Obviously you want the instrument you practice on to be in a room where it can be played whenever you want.</p>

            <h3>Combine Practice and Gaming</h3>

            <div className={globalStyle.leftAlign}>
                <p>Everytime your character dies on a game, you play something on your instrument.</p>
                <p>This goes back to having your instrument in an easily accessible location, like right next to you while you play games.</p>
                <p>I once had a student who was doing very well with learning guitar, and so I asked him how much practice he gets in per day,</p>
                <p>and he said he gets around 2 to 3 hours per day!</p>
                <p>So I asked him, how and he said he plays a lot of video games, so when his character dies on the video game, he would play something on guitar.</p>
                <p>I used to also do this when I was younger. Everytime my character died on a fighting video game, I would have to do 10 push ups.</p>
                <p>Tying your practice to playing games, is a great way to make your practice much more fun, and thereby get more hours of practice in.</p>
