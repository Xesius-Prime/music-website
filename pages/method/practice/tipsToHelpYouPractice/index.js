            <h2>Tips to Help You Practice</h2>

            <div className={globalStyle.leftAlign}>
                <h3>1. Put Instrument in an Easily Accessible Location</h3>
                <p>Do you put it into a case or keep it out on a stand?</p>
                <p>Once I had a student who, after our lesson, she didn't take her guitar out of the case, but left it in the basement. I said no wonder she wasn't practicing, because she told me she spent most of her time in the living room upstairs, so in order for her to practice, she would have to go all the way downstairs to the cold basement, take the guitar out of the case, and get set up with her music etc, and then play, and unfortunately thats often too much to ask for many students.</p>
                <p>Even for me, which is why I put my instruments I want to play in the most easily accessible locations. For my guitar it's literally in arms length from my chair I'm sitting in right now.</p>
                <p>For my piano, it's just downstairs, and when take a break from some stuff I'm working on, I like to go get a refreshing drink, or get something to snack on, and I lets say I'm toasting some bread, or boiling some water for tea. While I'm waiting for the bread to toast or the water to boil, I will often sit down at my piano, which is right there, and play a few pieces.</p>
                <p>Practice while you play other things. For instance, if you play video games, then do a little practice every time your character dies.</p>
                <p>Use playing music as a way to take a break from work.</p>
