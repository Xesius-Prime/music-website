                <p>Practice routines can look like anything, but here are some ideas of what I do, and have done, and have seen other people do.</p>

            <div className={globalStyle.divider}></div>

            <h3>The Ultimate</h3>
            <div className={globalStyle.leftAlign}>
                <p>I don't do it as much anymore, but there was a time when I would designate a certain amount of time to each area of music everyday, for the most well rounded practice routine.</p>

                <p>Here's a list of all the things you could practice if you added everything, and had the most well rounded practice routine:</p>
                <br />




                <h3>Unrehearsed Reading Pieces:</h3>

                <p>This is when you practice playing songs you've never seen before, or have played only a few times.</p>

                <p>This is done in order to get better at being able to pick up ANY piece, and play the song well on first, or first few reads.</p>


                <div className={globalStyle.indentOne}>
                    <h3>One of my favourites:</h3>
                    <p>For my own practice recently, I've tended towards basically just doing this.</p>
                    <p>The reason why is because: <br />- I love the variety it gives me, because I could essentially read any piece I feel like playing that day. A variety of any difficulty, and any composer. Some days I want to play easy Romantic Era pieces, and some days I want to play difficult Baroque, etc etc.</p>
                    <p>- and secondly, </p>

                    <br />

                    <h3>Enhances variety of choice:</h3>
                    <p>I love the ability to pick up a new piece I have never seen before, and actually being able to immediately play it fairly well just by reading it, because when you can do that you are open to play a large variety of songs.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h3>Builds dexterity:</h3>
                    <p>Some pieces are technically difficult, and as you play through the piece slowly, you will be building your dexterity ability</p>
                    <br />


                    <h3>Inevitably builds your repertoire:</h3>
                    <p>As you play various songs, you will inevitably get better and better at them each play through, and so eventually you will master the piece, and now you've got it as one of your mastered pieces which you can play at shows etc.</p>
                    <br />

                    <h3>Builds library:</h3>
                    <p>You can begin to collect books here and there, and eventually you will have a library of pieces to play from. You can also find pieces on online libraries like MuseScore.</p>

                    <p>Literally all you do is have some books that you enjoy playing from that have a mix of pieces you are good at, and some you've never seen before, and ones inbetween, and you just try to read through them.</p>

                    <br />


                    <h3>It builds ability to play impromptu:</h3>
                    <p>Imagine all the benefits that come from being able to just pick up a piece of music and play it, like you do with everyday text based language.</p>
                    <p>This inevitably leads us to our next one, Repertoire, because as you read through various pieces impromptu, you start to like this piece or that piece, and so you naturally play them more, and the more you play it, the more you master it, and next thing you know, it's one of your main pieces, and you've added it to your Repertoire.</p>

                    <br />

                <br />







                <br />
                <div className={globalStyle.divider}></div>
                <br />




                <h3>Repertoire:</h3>

                <p>This is when you play pieces from a book to master and memorize the piece and add it to your collection of mastered pieces (aka your repertoire).</p>
                <p>I used to do this moreso when I had to master pieces for shows, recitals, or examinations.</p>
                <p>It's nice because it allows you to really master pieces, and it's a good feeling when you've really mastered a piece.</p>
                <p>The problem might be that you play the same piece over and over, so it can be a bit repetitive, and this is why some people have difficulty continuing doing it.</p>
                <p>It's always good to have a balance and thats why when I did focus on mastering a piece I would balanbce it with other things (as shown below), like just cold reading random pieces for variety, or playing around with Improvisation.</p>
                <br />




                <h3>Theory:</h3>

                <p>Theory is just when someone notices an interesting pattern with music, and they give it a name and talk about the ways they can use it, or the ways it's used.</p>
                <p>This can be very empowering, because through the numerous years of humanity making sense of the patterns in music, you can learn them and have a whole new tool for your tool belt.</p>
                <p>I think of learning Theory like going to a tool shop, and getting a new tool. Once you learn how to use the new tool, there's all sorts of uses you can have for it. The same with theory. Each concept is a little tool, and you can start to use it in all sorts of interesting ways, for noticing the patterns in your pieces you play to understand what makes a piece of music work, and thereby also to be able to more easily play the piece, since you understand the patterns that it's composed of.</p>
                <br />




                <h3>Technique:</h3>
                <p>Technique is basically playing through scales, arpeggios, and chords etc, in the most efficient way you can.</p>
                <p>This is because, in music, certain patterns are used a lot. So if you isolate these patterns, and practice them in the most efficient way you can, using the best fingers etc, then when you want to use the patterns in your Improv, or when you have to play the pattern in a piece you are reading through, then you will be able to identify the pattern and easily play it.</p>
                <p>This is actually partly one of the big ways people are able to read and play music so quickly, because they aren't seeing every single note individually like a beginner is, but instead they see that group of notes as one of those recurring patterns, and because they practiced playing those patterns in the most efficient ways they could through Technique practice, when they see the pattern they can just let their muscle memory do the work for them.</p>
                <br />




                <h3>Improvisation:</h3>
                <p>Improvisation goes well with Theory and Technique, because Improvisation is a chance for you to play around with patterns you learned about in Theory.</p>
                <p>If you want to master Theory and remember it, it's highly adviseable to try to put the pattern to use some how in an Improv or Composition session, so you can bring it into physical reality and play around with it, instead of it just existing as a mental concept only.</p>
                <br />






                <h3>Composition:</h3>
                <p>This can be a great way to get better with Theory.</p>
                <p>You likely already know how important and valuable it is to be able to READ, and WRITE in life in general. This is why it's important to compose, because then you can begin to master your ability to write as well as read music.</p>
                <p>One of the best ways to practice and have fun playing around with composition, is with a notation software.</p>
                <p>The one I use is called MuseScore. It's completely free for people on their laptops, or desktop computers.</p>

            <div className={globalStyle.leftAlign}>
                <h3>Music History:</h3>
                <p>This one is one that many overlook, but you can learn a lot about music and ideas to impliment, by learning some Music History. Humans have been making music for a very long time, so to be able to look back and learn what people where doing in various eras, can really help you enrich yourself with a broader scope of their accumulated knowledge.</p>

                <p>Of course you don't have to do all of these in one day like I used to, but it can be good to know what they are do you can perhaps do some one day and another another day.</p>
